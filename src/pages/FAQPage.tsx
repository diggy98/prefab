      title: "General Questions",
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "What are prefab homes?",
          answer: "Prefab homes are houses that are manufactured in a factory setting and then transported to the building site for assembly. They offer superior quality control, faster construction times, and often better energy efficiency compared to traditional on-site construction."
        },
        {
          question: "How long does it take to build a prefab home?",
          answer: "Our prefab homes typically take 6-8 weeks to manufacture in our factory, with on-site assembly completed in just 3-5 days. The total timeline from order to move-in is usually 10-12 weeks, depending on site preparation and customization requirements."
        },
        {
          question: "Are prefab homes as durable as traditional homes?",
          answer: "Yes, our prefab homes are built to the same or higher standards as traditional homes. They're constructed using advanced materials like SIPs (Structural Insulated Panels) and are designed to meet or exceed all UK building codes and standards."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I customize my prefab home?",
          answer: "Absolutely! We offer extensive customization options including layout modifications, finish selections, energy upgrades, and smart home integrations. Our design team works with you to create a home that perfectly fits your needs and preferences."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "Design & Construction",
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "What is SIP construction?",
          answer: "SIP (Structural Insulated Panel) construction uses panels made of an insulating foam core sandwiched between two structural boards. This creates incredibly strong, energy-efficient walls that provide superior insulation and faster assembly times."
        },
        {
          question: "What house types do you offer?",
          answer: "We offer five main house types: Modular (flexible, expandable designs), Skandy-Nordy (Scandinavian-inspired minimalist), Smart (advanced home automation), Modern (contemporary aesthetics), and Modern-B (bold architectural elements)."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you provide architectural services?",
          answer: "Yes, we have an in-house team of architects and designers who work with you to create custom designs or modify our existing models to meet your specific requirements and site conditions."
        },
        {
          question: "What's included in a turnkey package?",
          answer: "Our turnkey packages include complete structural shell, premium insulation, triple-glazed windows, mechanical ventilation, fitted kitchen, bathroom suites, flooring, smart home systems, and professional installation with commissioning."

    {
      title: "Energy Efficiency",
      faqs: [
        {
          question: "What energy rating do your homes achieve?",
          answer: "All our homes are designed to achieve A+++ energy ratings and many are Passive House certified. This means extremely low energy consumption for heating and cooling, resulting in minimal utility bills."
        },
        {
          question: "How much can I save on energy bills?",
          answer: "Our clients typically report 50-90% savings on heating and cooling costs compared to traditional homes. Annual energy costs are often as low as £400-600 for a complete home."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you offer solar panel integration?",
          answer: "Yes, all our homes are pre-wired for solar panel installation. We can include solar panels, battery storage, and EV charging stations as part of your energy package."
        },
        {
          question: "What heating systems do you use?",
          answer: "We primarily use air-source heat pumps with underfloor heating systems, combined with mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) for optimal comfort and efficiency."
        }

    {
      title: "Pricing & Process",
      faqs: [

        },
        {
          question: "What's included in the base price?",
          answer: "Base prices include the complete structural package, standard finishes, basic mechanical systems, and standard assembly. Site preparation, utilities connections, and premium upgrades are additional."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you offer financing options?",
          answer: "We work with several financing partners to help make your prefab home affordable. We can connect you with lenders who specialize in prefab construction loans and mortgages."
        },
        {
          question: "What's the payment schedule?",
          answer: "Typically, we require a 10% deposit to begin design, 40% at manufacturing start, 40% at delivery, and 10% upon completion. Payment schedules can be customized based on your financing arrangements."
